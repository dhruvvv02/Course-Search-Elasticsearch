# üß† Course Search App (Spring Boot + Elasticsearch)

A Spring Boot application that uses Elasticsearch 8.12.2 to provide full-text search, autocomplete suggestions, and fuzzy matching for course data.

---

## üì¶ Features

- Full-text search on course `title` and `description`
- Filtering by category, type, age, price, and start date
- Sorting (price ascending/descending, session date)
- Autocomplete suggestions via **Completion Suggester**
- Fuzzy search to support typo tolerance (e.g., `"robots"` ‚Üí `"Robotics 101"`)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üê≥ 1. Launch Elasticsearch with Docker

Make sure Docker is installed. Then run:

```terminal
docker compose up 
```

This starts Elasticsearch 8.12.2 on `http://localhost:9200`.

If you don‚Äôt have a `docker-compose.yml` yet:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.12.2
    container_name: elasticsearch
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
```

---

### ‚òï 2. Build and Run the Spring Boot Application

```terminal
mvn spring-boot:run
```

By default, the app runs on:  
`http://localhost:8080`

---

## üìä Populate Sample Data

Upon startup, the `DataLoader` reads `sample-courses.json` from `src/main/resources` and indexes the courses to Elasticsearch.

Ensure the `courses` index has a **completion field** for autocomplete:

```

---

### 2. Autocomplete Suggestions

```http
GET /api/search/suggest?q={partialTitle}
```

#### Example:

```

  {
    "title": "Robotics 101",
    "description": "An engaging course designed to inspire and educate.",
    ...
  }
]
```
